                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p>My name is Jack Yi but you guys can call me Jack. I'm a business analyst graduate turned aspiring web developer and this is 
                    my first ever static website created from what I've learnt so far. The purpose of this website is not only to apply what I've learned
                    so far, but to also showcase my graphic design works. Just to note, this website is also responsive to different screen sizes so do 
                    check it out! Enjoy browsing :)</p>
                <p>I've also previously created a very simple website that documents my project (a simple game done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and other 
                    assignments that I've done for a module that I took during my last year of university. <a id="link" href="nm2207/index.html">Click here</a> 
                    for the links to my game and other assignments!</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Just a little back story on why I chose to change my career path.</p>
                <p>
                    I am a business analytics graduate from National University of Singapore (NUS).
                    Business analytics is a degree offered by School of Computing which thus provided me
                    with exposure to coding languages such as Java, R, and mainly Python. During university, I was also the Publicity Head
                    for my dance club which my main responsibility was to design publicity materials
                    and merchandises for our club.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was first exposed to designing when I was learning how to edit videos and thumbnails for my YouTube
                    channel back in my teenage days. During those years, I learnt how to use Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro from the internet. 
                    Since then design has always been just a hobby. Even when applied for the role
                    as a Publicity Head, designing was still something that I've never thought would be a possible career path to take.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, I was mainly focusing on my business analyst degree till I learnt about front-end development and web design
                    from my colleagues during internship in my third year of uni. That's when I thought: <blockquote>"Could this be something that I can pursue as a career?".</blockquote> 
                    Hence I took up an introductory module on front-end development
                    during my last year of uni and I must say I absolutely enjoyed the module and did well for it. You can view my assignments and my final project, where we
                    had to create a game, <a id="link" href="nm2207/index.html">here</a>!
                </p>
                <p>Fast forward to graduation, I followed the
                    natural course of taking up an offer for a business analytics graduate program. 
                    However throughout my program, I could not stop thinking about doing web development as my career instead and how it would possibly be 
                    something that I would want to do for the rest of my life. So here I am, taking the leap of faith to work towards web development / design.

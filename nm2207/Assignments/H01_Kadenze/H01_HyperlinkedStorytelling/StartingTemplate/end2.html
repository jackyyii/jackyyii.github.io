        You tried opening the door with the <b>key</b>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To your surprise, the door magically opened.
      </p>
      <p>
        You walked out to the open woods. You walked for minutes, to hours, and the exit is nowhere to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, your body can no longer support your weight, and you slowly lose your concsious into the cold, dark, woods.
